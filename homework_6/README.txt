IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
- Please view at 1366 x 768 screen ratio, these were the dimensioned I designed for.
- The Shopping Cart page (Your Bag) is only partially functional given that it was not required to be fully functional for 6A. It currently updates the correct quantity and calculates price, but it does not update size and color chosen. 
- The product detail page that I implemented is the Cat Backpack. The only product images that are clickable are the cat backpack.
